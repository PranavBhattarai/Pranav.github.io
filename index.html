			Disclaimer: This is a profolio website. Its in a Beta stage. I DO NOT tend to share

			Note: 
			i) Frist thing is is first, every content provided here is based on Pokhara University's BCA syllabals. <br><br>
			ii) Answers are NOT complete yet. I update the answer locally in my machine, but that doesn't mean I update my answer in similarly in the website too. 
			For that you might need to remaind me, or ask me directly. I have a personal life too. I can't maintain this repo every 
			time when I make little changes or add new answers. So don't hesitate to ask me. <br><br>
			iii) You are copy/reuse/rewrite hell out of my answers/questions. But not including my name or my contribution under in APP in any form is cheap thing to do. 
			So don't cheap. Be Open source freindly. <br><br>

			iv) Everytime I make some changes in answer, I will change the version number too, so that easier for you to 
			understand whether the note you have download is updated or not.<br><br>

			I have also added "Completion rate", which determines how much answer has completed out of total questions. <br><br>
			
			Tips: Use Firefox to view the pdf from Laptop/Desktop in full screen. <br><br>
			
			//IDR = I Don't Recommend. Means its too raw. Those notes which include IDR tag, please don't fully depend on that note.
