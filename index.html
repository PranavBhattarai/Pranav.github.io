			Note: 
			The answers are NOT complete yet. I update the answer locally in my machine, but that doesn't
			mean I update my answer in similarly in the cloud (a.k.a in this website) too. For that you might
			need to remaind me, or ask me directly. I have a personal life too. I can't maintain this repo every 
			time when I make little changes or add new answers. So don't hesitate to ask me. <br><br>

			Everytime I make some changes in answer, I will change the version number too, so that easier for you to 
			understand whether the note you have download is updated or not.<br><br>

			I have also added "Completion rate", which determines how much answer has completed out of total questions.
