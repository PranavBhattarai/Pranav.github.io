				<li>Frist thing is is first, every content provided here is based on Pokhara University's BCA syllabals. </li><br>

				<li>Answers are NOT complete yet. I update the answer locally in my machine, but that doesn't mean I update my answer in similarly in the website too. For that you might need to remaind me, or ask me directly. I have a personal life too. I can't maintain this repo every time when I make little changes or add new answers. So don't hesitate to ask me.</li><br>
			
				<li>You can copy/reuse/rewrite hell out of my answers/questions. But not including my name or my contribution in your APP/Website in any form is bad thing to do. So don't be a bad guy. Be Open source freindly. ;-D </li><br>

				<li>Everytime I make some changes in answer, I'll change the version number too, so that easier for you to understand whether the note you have download is updated or not. I have also added "Completion rate", which determines how much answer has completed out of total questions.</li><br>	
			</ol>
				IDR literally means, "I Don't Recommend". Means its too raw. Those notes which include IDR tag, please don't fully depend on that note.
